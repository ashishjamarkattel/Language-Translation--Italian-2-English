## Language Translation 

Code contains the language translation from italian to english using 
encoder-decoder model ie __SEQ 2 SEQ__ model.

The model was trained with :

__LOSS__ : 0.21 \
__BLEU_SCORE__ : 0.41

### 
#### PLACE FOR IMPROVEMENT
### 

- The score could be far improved if __LSTM unit__ and __DENSE layer__ was increased. 
- More Training data could have been used.
- If trained for bit longer however i used only 15 epoch to train.
- Best learning was 0.002 where i tried using 0.001 and 3e-10 for adam but result was not satisfactory.
